Scope in JavaScript refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables and expressions
scope variables: local variables
global variables: when you declare the variable from outside the function.
var: declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const: can't change the value. It is constant

let: declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

var, let and const are locals when they are used inside the function and they are global when they are used outside function

if/else, for/while:
  var is global whereas others are local.

the folder "public" helps express to access js, css or images
